# What is Amazon Elastic Container Service?<a name="Welcome"></a>

* Amazon ECS
  * FULLY managed container orchestration service / 
    * helps you easily about containerized applications 
      * deploy,
      * manage,
      * scale
    * -> 
      * built-in AWS configuration & operational best practices 
        * Reason: ðŸ§  it's fully managed ðŸ§ 
      * ðŸ‘€NO need to manage control plane, nodes, or add\-ons ðŸ‘€
    * regional service
  * integrations
    * with
      * AWS tools &
        * _Example:_ Amazon ECR
      * TP tools
        * _Example:_ Docker
    * benefits
      * focus on building the applications
        * NOT the environment
  * key features
    + serverless option -- via -- AWS Fargate
      + AWS Fargate 
        + allows
          + forgetting (== NO need to) manage servers,
          + handle capacity planning,
            + _Example:_ -- based on -- your 
              + resource needs,
              + isolation policies,
              + availability requirements 
          + isolate container workloads -- for -- security
    + external instance option / ECS Anywhere

      + typical actions 
        + Monitors changes | source code repository
        + Builds a new Docker image -- from -- that source
        + Pushes the image | image repository (_Example:_ Amazon ECR or Docker Hub)
        + Updates your Amazon ECS services -- to use the -- new image | your application
    + -- support for -- service discovery
      + use cases
        + distributed systems & SOA architectures
      + allows
        + your microservice components -- are automatically -- discovered | they're created & terminated | given infrastructure

## Launch types<a name="launch-types"></a>

* models to run your containers
  + Fargate launch type
    + ðŸ‘€== serverless pay-as-you-go option ðŸ‘€
      + == host your containers | Fargate (serverless infrastructure) / -- is managed by -- Amazon ECS
    + allows
      + running containers / WITHOUT needing to manage your infrastructure
    + use cases
      + workloads /
        + large / need optimization -- for -- low overhead 
        + Small / have occasional burst
        + Tiny workloads
        + Batch workloads
    + requirements
      + AWS Regions / Amazon ECS -- supports -- AWS Fargate
  + EC2 launch type
    + == configure & deploy EC2 instances | your cluster / run your containers
    + use cases
      + workloads /
        + require consistently high CPU core & memory usage
        + large workloads / need optimization -- for -- price
      + applications / -- need to access -- persistent storage
      + you MUST directly manage your infrastructure
